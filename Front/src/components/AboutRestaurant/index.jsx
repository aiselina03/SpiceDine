          <p>
            We believe independent restaurants occupy a distinctive position in
            the world of business. They are visible, important and integral
            parts of the communities they serve. Unlike their chain
            counterparts, people often have a personal connection to one or more
            of their home grown restaurants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawing on their respective experiences in the hospitality industry,
            the imagined a place celebrating the Londonâ€™s festive spirit,
            generous cuisine and friendly atmosphere.
